### Description

This mod allows you to stabilize the EMC value of items, preventing them from being transmuted. <br>
To stabilize the EMC of an item, craft it together with the stabilization tape. <br>
Craft it with the destabilization scissors to undo the stabilization. <br>

NBT Tags can be added in the config, to stabilize any item with that tag permanently. <br>
Contains `omniwand:data` and `akashictome:data` by default. <br>
The stabilization items can also be completely disabled in the config, if you only want the nbt feature. <br>
